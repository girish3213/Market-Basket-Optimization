The dataset is of a shop made by the shop-owner based on the items purchased by the customers over a week.
The ML model has been implemented in two ways:
<ol>
  <li> Apriori Rule Associative Learning Algorithm </li>
  <li> Eclat Rule Associative Learning Algorithm </li> 
  </ol>
  
  
The ML Apriori Associative learning algorithm has been deployed to find the associations and correlations amongst the purchased items.Apriori algorithm evaluates the results based on three parameters: Support, Confidence and Lift whilst the Eclat algorithm categorizes the associations only based on support.This would then help the shop-owner to give attractive offers based on the analyzed data and increase the sales.
